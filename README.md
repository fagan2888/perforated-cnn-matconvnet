# perforated-cnn-matconvnet

PerforatedCNNs accelerate convolutional neural networks (CNNs) by skipping evaluation of the convolutional layers in some of the spatial positions. See the paper for more details:

Michael Figurnov, Aijan Ibraimova, Dmitry Vetrov, Pushmeet Kohli. PerforatedCNNs: Acceleration through Elimination of Redundant Convolutions. _NIPS 2016_ [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.08362)].

The code is based on MatConvNet from December 2014, with some backports (such as more aggressive memory savings for ReLU).

See also [Caffe](https://github.com/mfigurnov/perforated-cnn-caffe) implementation of PerforatedCNNs.

## Installation

Clone the repository, run MATLAB, go to `acceleration` directory. Compile the code:

```matlab
setup;
vl_compilenn('enableGpu', true, 'enableImReadJpeg', true);
```

Run some tests:

```matlab
vl_test_nnconv_perf(0); vl_test_nnconv_perf(1);
vl_test_nnpool_fast(0); vl_test_nnpool_fast(1);
```

## Experiment: perforation of whole network

See sections 3.3 and 4.3 of the paper for details.

Download `.mat` files with network weights and CIFAR-10 dataset from [here](https://yadi.sk/d/4NWM-lb3mca5G). Put them into the root folder.
Navigate into `acceleration` directory. There is a script per network:

1. Network in Network for CIFAR-10: `cifar_greedy_perforation`
2. AlexNet: `alexnet_greedy_perforation`
3. VGG-16: `vgg_greedy_perforation`

Set `dataDir` path in the AlexNet and VGG-16 scripts if you want to build perforated networks for ImageNet.
Change the `useGpuTimings` setting to select the target device for a perforated network (CPU or GPU).
Example:
```matlab
setup;
cifar_greedy_perforation('useGpuTimings', true);
```

## MatConvNet's original README

**MatConvNet** is a MATLAB toolbox implementing *Convolutional Neural
Networks* (CNNs) for computer vision applications. It is simple,
efficient, and can run and learn state-of-the-art CNNs. Several
example CNNs are included to classify and encode images. Please visit
the [homepage](http://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet) to know more.
